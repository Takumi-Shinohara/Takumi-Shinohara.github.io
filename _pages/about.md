I am a visiting researcher at [Namerikawa Laboratory](https://www.namerikawa.sd.keio.ac.jp/en/) of [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), Tokyo, Japan.
I received my B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from Keio University in 2016, 2018, and 2024, respectively.
My research centers around theoretical analysis to develop secure and resilient control systems, with main interests in the secure state estimation problem and vulnerability analysis in control systems.

I am also a consultant at [Mitsubishi Research Institute](https://www.mri.co.jp/en/) since 2018, where I mainly engage in research and study for cybersecurity policy in Japan.
