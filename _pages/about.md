I am a Ph.D. student in control theory at [Namerikawa Laboratory](https://www.namerikawa.sd.keio.ac.jp/en/) of [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), Tokyo, Japan.
My research centers around theoretical analysis to develop secure and resilient control systems, with main interests in the secure state estimation problem and vulnerability analysis in control systems.

I am also a consultant at [Mitsubishi Research Institute](https://www.mri.co.jp/en/) since 2018, where I mainly engage in research and study for cybersecurity policy in Japan.
